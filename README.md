# Meet Alp aka "buzz"

I'm a Full-Stack developer who has been coding JavaScript and TypeScript web apps since 2020. I'm now trying to learn more about Go to actually switch to it.
I mainly use NextJS and ReactJS for my Front-End and ExpressJS for backend.

I have coded and designed my projects over the years so I know the designing aspect of a website as well.

I'm the leader of a group called Wowl Studios that design coding tools, game scripts and websites.
I coded 100% and designed 60% of this website we made as Wowl Studios for Kampus Kres: [View Website](https://kampuskres.com.tr/).

I'm currently coding an open-sourced project, keep an eye on me üëÄ.
